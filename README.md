# Ensemble Classification Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on building an ensemble model using stacking, which consists of a layer of weak classifiers based on bagging, and then combined by a strong classifier. The project includes the development of a synthetic dataset, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using various machine learning models.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Involves cleaning, normalizing, and encoding data to prepare it for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into the dataset through visualizations and statistical analysis.
- **Model Training**: Applies several machine learning algorithms to train the classification models.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
